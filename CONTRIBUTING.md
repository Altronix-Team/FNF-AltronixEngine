# More Information on Contributing to Altronix Engine

## Branches
`main` is the repository's main branch, so people can clone a stable Altronix Engine to work on their mods. However, this means that Pull Requests will default to merge into
`main` instead of `master`.

### If your pull request changes the engine, it merges into MASTER.

This really took this long to document. Why?
