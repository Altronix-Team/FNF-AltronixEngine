## Features

This mod features the following:

* Adds Tricky (Mask) as a usable Dad character.
* Adds Improbable Outset as a song to Free Play (currently uses the default stage).

This mod does not currently include:

* The Tricky (Unmasked) character.
* The Tricky (Hellclown) character.
* The Tricky (Expurgation) character.
* The song Madness.
* The song Hellclown.
* The song Expurgation.
* The custom stages (`nevada`, `nevadaSpook`, and `auditorHell`).
* A playable story week.
* Custom note types.
* Custom song behavior (such as obstructions or health drain).
* A custom title screen.
* A custom main menu.
* A main menu trophy for beating the story.
* Unlocking Expurgation only after beating the story on Hard.

## Notes

* `_polymod_meta.json` includes data used for the mod menu.
* `_polymod_icon.png` includes the icon used for the mod menu.
* All other assets use the proper file names and locations of the respective files in the `assets` folder, so that ModCore performs the replacement when the mod loads.
* New assets are simply placed in their proper locations where the game can locate them.
  * New characters are created by initializing a custom character metadata file, which includes necessary offsets and animation prefix names.
  * New songs are created simply by placing their music in the `songs` folder, their charts in the `data/songs` folder, and the song ID, week number, and character name for the icon to use in `_append/data/freeplaySongnames.txt`.
