## Friday Night Funkin'

> Uh oh! Your tryin to kiss ur hot girlfriend, but her MEAN and EVIL dad is trying to KILL you! He's an ex-rockstar, the only way to get to his heart? The power of music... 

## Altronix Engine (Currently in develop)
**Altronix Engine** is a mod for Friday Night Funkin' based on Kade Engine, including an engine rework, and more.

**REMEMBER**: This is a **mod**. This is not the vanilla game and should be treated as a **modification**. This is not and probably will never be official, so don't get confused.
